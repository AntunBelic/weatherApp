# weatherApp

## Description

In Croatian, the word "vrijeme" means both time and forecast depending on the context,
so I decided to make an app that shows both for any place in the world.

## How to use

When launching the application, you need to allow the use of the location
so that you can get information related to where you are,
and then feel free to search for the desired location.
